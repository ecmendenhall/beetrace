# beetrace

Plays a sound effect from "Bee Movie" on every system call. You need to [disable SIP](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208762/now-that-el-capitan-is-rootless-is-there-any-way-to-get-dtrace-working). This is the stupidest thing I've ever put on Github.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ecmendenhall/beetrace.git
$ cd beetrace
$ ./beetrace.d
```
